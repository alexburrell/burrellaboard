##AKA "Alex tries to make a keyboard"

This project is just for fun, and to learn iOS development. Making a keyboard also gives me the chance to try to do some really cool NLP things, like spelling correction and word prediction.

##To do list
- Get the darn thing on my phone
- Add a prediction bar above the keys
- Identify misspellings and suggest corrections
- Identify which letters are most likely to be next
- Identify most likely next words
